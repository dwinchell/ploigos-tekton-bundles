# What is this directory?
This directory contains tasks downloaded from the Tekton Catalog. Some of them have been modified. Each yaml file is a task.

Each task in the catalog has a label in its yaml definition, `app.kubernetes.io/version`, that will tell you what version was downloaded to this directory. There are upgrade instructions below.

# License
All downloaded Tasks are subject to the Apache Licesnse version 2.0. Please see the LICENSE file in this directory for details.

# How To
## Add a New Task from the Catalog
* Download the yaml for the new version from https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/.
* Place the file in this directory.

# Modify the Code of a Task from the Catalog
* Be aware that if you upgrade the task to a new version published in the catalog, you will have to make the modifications again.
* Update the yaml file for the task in this directory.
* Note the change in this file.

# Upgrade a Task from the Catalog
* (If there were code modifications) Check what was modified - download the old version of the task and diff it against what is in this directory.
* Download the yaml for the new version from https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/.
* Replace the yaml in this directory with the downloaded version.
* (If there were code modifications) You have to make them again. Look at the diff from Step 1 to help with this.
* (If there were code modifications) Consider contributing the modifications upstream, so that you don't have to make the changes again every time you upgrade the task.
* Update this file with the new version and URL
